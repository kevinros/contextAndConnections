      "Query:  Legal/political fallout - none. It was done with a warrant, which means that there was enough evidence to convince a judge to sign the warrant. If the Trump administration wants to try to make political hay about it, they are going to be going to bat for someone that is about to indicted (according to a new NY Times story), and that won't look so good. It certainly doesn't vindicate Trump, who was trying to paint the picture of a Nixonian/Watergate sort of scandal to spy on his campaign when he claimed that he and Trump Tower were the targets of wiretapping, though he should probably be worried about any conversations he had with Manafort during that time. So, smoking gun? It remains to be seen. <C> &gt;It was done with a warrant, which means that there was enough evidence to convince a judge to sign the warrant. Well, no. The issue was never just that a judge issued warrants for Russia witch hunt wiretaps (though many of us strongly suspect DNC meddling in that). The issue was that political appointees in the Obama administration were unmasking the names of Trump employees 'incidentally' caught on wiretap and were sharing that information with the corrupt DNC and the media. That being said, I don't think this will change much, because it's not news. As much as Hillary and Obama tried to kill the story, it's been known for months that Trump Tower was wiretapped. It's just hitting the media now because *someone* - probably someone whose book tour is a complete bust - feels like now is a good time to try and make Trump look bad. Because it's not like we have any real problems going on with North Korea or hurricane season or so on that a more patriotic opposition party might leave Our President to handle with a stab-free back...\n",
